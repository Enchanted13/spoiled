# <img src="./icon.png" alt="egg-icon"/> Spoiled

A Chrome extension that blocks content using any provided keywords. Stop spoilers, sports, or celebrity click-bait from ruining your interwebs.

## To Install
Clone this repository and then follow [Google's Instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

A few more features need to get in this tool before I look into putting it on the Chrome store.

* [x] Better Twitter and Facebook coverage
* [x] Delete individual terms
* [x] Sync terms between browsers
* [ ] Prettier blocked content

## Contribute
I'd love help from any other spoiler haters out there. This is my first Chrome extension and my javascript skills are in a constant state of staleness.

**Let's make this thing...**
* Fast
* Simple and usable
* Configurable
* Pretty

**Things we don't like about other extensions**
* Social logins
* User data collection
* Slow and heavy-handed
